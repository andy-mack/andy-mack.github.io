            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    I am a software engineer specializing in Java.<br>Started my IT career as a Helpdesk specialist about 15 years ago, I moved to a server deployment and support department. At that time I participated in the implementation of new Identity Management software based on IBM.<br>I started to learn development as a hobby by trying to make an Android application in 2013. Since that, I have used my development skills in my main job. Mostly scripts and utilities at the beginning.<br>After leading the monitoring department, I moved to the implementation and development of Identity Systems and start developing workflow logic on Javascript and later using Java.\n  </p>",
